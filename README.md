Hey there, I'm Mohit, a self-taught Data Scientist with a passion for diving into the worlds of AI and ML/DL. 
The thrill of exploring new tech keeps me on my toes. I'm all about the love for numbers and logic. 
Think of me like a brain cell, tweaking its connections as I learn and do, to get better at the game.
